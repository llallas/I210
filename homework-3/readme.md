### Looping to the DOM

### Understanding

JavaScript may work with a structured representation of a webpage called the Document Object Model (DOM). Every HTML element is a node in the tree-like structure that is created when a webpage loads in a browser. As a result, JavaScript may dynamically access and alter the page without requiring a page reload. By establishing a connection between web content and scripts, the DOM makes it possible for interactive features like dynamic element addition, style updates, text changes, and user event management.
